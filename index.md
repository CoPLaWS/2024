# CoPLaWS 2024 - the 2nd Copenhagen Programming Languages Workshop

[CoPLaWS](https://coplaws.github.io) is a series of annual workshops for programming language researchers working in the greater Copenhagen area, open to academics (DTU, KU, ITU, RUC) and researchers in industry and other institutions. The aim is to get together and learn about each other's work.

**[CoPLaWS 2024](https://coplaws.github.io/2024)** is the second edition of the workshop. It will take place at the **[DTU Meeting Centre in Lyngby, room M1](https://maps.app.goo.gl/kVfwgY6QWkNMGx5k6)**, on **Friday 23 August 2024**. It will be a full-day event including dinner (at the expense of the participants).

**Title:** Embedding Languages in Lean

**Abstract:** Lean is both an interactive theorem prover and a functional programming language. The Lean compiler, which is written in Lean itself, has an extensible frontend, including a customizable parser, a Racket-inspired hygienic macro system, and a rich compiler API that is used to implement both Lean's tactic framework and its own elaborator. These features make Lean into a capable host for embedded domain-specific languages. This talk will be an example-driven tour of what is made possible for EDSLs by the coming together of the traditions of typed functional programming, Racket, and interactive theorem provers based on dependent types in Lean.

## Call for Talks 

We invite proposals for 20-minute talks for the workshop. Since there are many programming language researchers in Copenhagen, it is likely that we will get more talk proposals than can fit in a day. In that event, the talks will be selected by the organisers based on a light reviewing process. We will aim for diversity in topics and institutions represented. 

Talk proposals should consist of a title and a one-paragraph abstract. No need to submit any PDF.
